# Reddit Scroller

Reddit Scroller is a web application to search Reddit's subreddits only for the pictures, and present them in a scrollable form. <br>
It uses React and Reddit's API as its main technologies. It's built in a responsive layout and perfect for mobile.

## How Does It work?

Pretty simple: You type the subreddit and hit the "SCROLL!" button. This gives you the first page of that subreddit, and <br>
more images get loaded as you keep scrolling down. The limit is your RAM.

## To Run Locally

After downloading the repository, run "npm install" command inside the client folder to install dependencies. <br>
Then run "npm start" to run the application. It should open a browser but if it doesn't, you can connect the app <br>
via address localhost:3000 on any browser.  

## Current Bugs

-The button that redirects you to the original post doesn't work. 
-If the given subreddit has no pictures in one of its pages, fetching of new pictures stop there.

## Upcoming Fix
